# NAME

CGI::Easy::SendFile - send files from CGI to browser

# VERSION

This document describes CGI::Easy::SendFile version v2.0.0

# SYNOPSIS

    use CGI::Easy::SendFile qw( send_file );

    my $r = CGI::Easy::Request->new();
    my $h = CGI::Easy::Headers->new();

    my $data = send_file($r, $h, '/path/file.zip');
    print $h->compose();
    print ${$data};

    # -- send "file" generated in memory instead of real file
    my $dynamic_file = '…some binary data…';
    my $data = send_file($r, $h, \$dynamic_file);

    # -- simulate static image served by web server 
    #    (without "download file" dialog popup in browser)
    my $data = send_file($r, $h, 'avatar.png', {
            type    => 'image/png',
            cache   => 1,
            inline  => 1,
    });

# DESCRIPTION

This module provide single function, which helps you prepare CGI reply for
sending file to browser.

# EXPORTS

Nothing by default, but all documented functions can be explicitly imported.

# INTERFACE 

- send\_file( $r, $h, $file, \\%opt )

    Prepare HTTP headers and content for CGI reply to send file.

        $r      CGI::Easy::Request object
        $h      CGI::Easy::Headers object
        $file   STRING (file name) or SCALARREF (file contents)
        %opt
          {type}    STRING (default "application/x-download")
          {range}   BOOL (default TRUE if $file is STRING,
                                  FALSE if $file is SCALARREF)
          {cache}   BOOL (default FALSE)
          {inline}  BOOL (default FALSE)

    - {type}

        Custom value for 'Content-Type' header. These are equivalents:

            $data = send_file($r, $h, $file, {type=>'image/png'});

            $data = send_file($r, $h, $file);
            $h->{'Content-Type'} = 'image/png';

    - {range}

        Enable/disable support for sending partial file contents, if requested
        (this is usually used by file downloader applications to fetch files
        faster using several simultaneous connections to download different file
        parts). You shouldn't enable this option for dynamic files generated by
        your CGI if contents of these files may differ for different CGI requests
        sent by same user to same url.

        If your web server configured to gzip CGI replies, it will disable this
        feature. To make this feature working disable gzip in web server (usually
        by adding ` SetEnv no-gzip ` in ` .htaccess ` file).

        When enabled and user requested partial contents will change 'Status' to
        '206 Partial Content'.

    - {cache}

        Enable/disable caching file contents.

        HTTP header 'Expires' will be removed if {cache} is TRUE, or set to 
        'Sat, 01 Jan 2000 00:00:00 GMT' if {cache} is FALSE.

        If {cache} is TRUE and $file is STRING will set 'Last-Modified' header;
        when browser use 'If-Modified-Since' and file doesn't changed will set
        'Status' to '304 Not Modified' and return REF to empty string to avoid
        sending any needless data to browser.

        You may want to add custom 'ETag' caching manually:

            $h->{ETag} = calc_my_ETag($file);
            if ($r->{ENV}{IF_NONE_MATCH} eq $h->{ETag}) {
                $h->{Status} = '304 Not Modified';
                $data = \q{};
            } else {
                $data = send_file($r, $h, $file, {cache=>1});
            }
            print $h->compose(), ${$data};

    - {inline}

        Try to control how browser should handle sent file (this have sense only
        for file types which browser can just show instead of asking user where to
        save downloaded file on disk - like images).

        If FALSE will set 'Content-Disposition' to 'attachment', this should force
        browser to save downloaded file instead of just showing it.

    Return SCALARREF with (full/partial/empty) file contents which should be
    send as body of CGI reply.

# LIMITATIONS

Sending large files will use a lot of memory - this module doesn't use
temporary files and keep everything in memory.
